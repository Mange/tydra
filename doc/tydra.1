.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tydra is a menu\-based shortcut runner based on the Hydra system in
Emacs.
.PP
It works by reading an \[lq]action file\[rq] that defines the full menu.
Each menu has several pages, where one page at a time can be shown.
Each page has one or more entries, each of which has a shortcut key, a
command, and a label.
.PP
With these building blocks you can build deeply nested menus with a
diverse range of commands, all behind a very simple shortcut system.
.PP
Contrast having to remember long commands (in terminal), or long
complicated shortcuts (in GUI), with a single command/shortcut and then
having a menu overlaid with each entry a single keystroke away.
.PP
Tydra makes it easier to add new things to your setup without having to
come up with a globally unique shortcut, while still being possible to
remember it even when it is not used often.
.PP
Some possible use\-cases:
.IP \[bu] 2
Control your media player.

.IP \[bu] 2
Bookmark programs with specific arguments, or websites.
.IP \[bu] 2
Keep track of commonly used \[lq]recipes\[rq] and scripts.
