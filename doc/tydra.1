.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tydra is a menu-based shortcut runner based on the Hydra system in
Emacs.
.PP
It works by reading an \[lq]action file\[rq] that defines the full menu.
Each menu has several pages, where one page at a time can be shown.
Each page has one or more entries, each of which has a shortcut key, a
command, and a label.
.PP
With these building blocks you can build deeply nested menus with a
diverse range of commands, all behind a very simple shortcut system.
.PP
Contrast having to remember long commands (in terminal), or long
complicated shortcuts (in GUI), with a single command/shortcut and then
having a menu overlaid with each entry a single keystroke away.
.PP
Tydra makes it easier to add new things to your setup without having to
come up with a globally unique shortcut, while still being possible to
remember it even when it is not used often.
.PP
Some possible use-cases:
.IP \[bu] 2
Control your media player.
.IP \[bu] 2
Change your screen brightness and volume without RSI.
.IP \[bu] 2
Bookmark programs with specific arguments, or websites.
.IP \[bu] 2
Keep track of commonly used \[lq]recipes\[rq] and scripts.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]-h\f[R], \f[B]--help\f[R]
Prints quick reference of options.
.TP
\f[B]-e\f[R], \f[B]--ignore-exit-status\f[R]
Do not exit Tydra when a command fails.
.TP
\f[B]--validate\f[R]
Instead of running the menu, exit with exit status \f[I]0\f[R] if the
provided menu file is valid.
If it is not valid, all validation errors will be shown on
\f[I]stderr\f[R] and the program will exit with a non-zero status code.
.TP
\f[B]--version\f[R]
Show the version of the process and exit.
.TP
\f[B]-p\f[R] \f[I]NAME\f[R], \f[B]--page\f[R] \f[I]NAME\f[R]
Start on the page with the provided \f[I]NAME\f[R].
Defaults to \f[I]root\f[R] if not specified.
Note that \f[B]--validate\f[R] will take this into account too.
.TP
\f[B]--generate-completions\f[R] \f[I]SHELL\f[R]
Generate a completion script for the given shell, print it to standard
out, and exit.
This will ignore any other options.
You can find a list of supported shells in the \f[B]--help\f[R] output.
