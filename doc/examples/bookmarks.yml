# This is an example showing how to present bookmarks in tydra.
#
# The repeated "mode: background" causes the command to run without a
# connection to this process or terminal, effectively detaching from the
# terminal. The assumption being that `xdg-open` would spawn an X app. If you
# are using your terminal for these bookmarks, the "exec" mode is a better
# choice.
# "mode: background" is not needed for most web browsers as they usually fork
# or signal an already running browser to open a new tab, but a lot of file
# manager do not fork like that and would keep the terminal open while you
# browsed files.
